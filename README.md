# TeamsBusyLight
TeamsBusyLight is a simple Python-based solution for windows user that detects active Microsoft Teams calls and triggers a physical light (e.g., LED, USB lamp, or relay) to visually indicate the user's call status.
This is perfect for home offices or shared workspaces where a visual "Do Not Disturb" signal can help avoid interruptions during meetings.
